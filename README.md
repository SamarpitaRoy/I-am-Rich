I started with iOS Development from yesterday 6/7/2023. I am following the course "iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu! Really excited to track my progress from Day 1 with the help of GitHub! I will keep commiting a lot of projects, both learned from the instructor and also from me. 
The "I-Am-Rich" Application does nothing but display a label and an image, saying that I Am Rich. It mimics the famous app "I Am Rich" made by Armin Heinrich.
